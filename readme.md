# The Good Company - Website

The official website for the good company! created using HTML, JS and CSS. We wanted to make a minimal, simple yet attractive while maintaining it's blazing performance (I mean, nobody uses internet explorer anymore :D). After few days of experimenting, we ended up with this - a simply beautifully crafted website for our startup. Oh, also - if you got any ideas to make it even better, PR it! we will check it out :D
